# Frostiq BakeryBackend

## Overview
Frostiq's BakeryBackend is a FastAPI-based backend service for managing user favorites in a bakery application. It supports adding, listing, and deleting favorite items for users, with robust validation and access control.

## Features
- Add, list, and delete user favorites
- Duplicate detection to prevent redundant entries
- Input validation for item names
- Resource-level authorization for deletion
- SQLite database (file always stored in `BakeryBackend/`)
- Ready for unit/integration testing with pytest


## Deployed Application

You can explore and test all API endpoints using the built-in **Swagger UI**:  
[https://frostiq-bakery-backend.onrender.com/docs](https://frostiq-bakery-backend.onrender.com/docs)

---

## API Testing via Swagger UI

Swagger provides an interactive way to test the API:

### Available Endpoints:
- `GET /favorites/{user_id}` – Fetch all favorite items for a user  
- `POST /favorites` – Add a new item to favorites  
- `DELETE /favorites/{user_id}/{item_id}` – Remove an item from favorites

You can view request/response formats and try out the endpoints directly in your browser.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd frostiq
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js (v14 or higher) - for most subprojects

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/frostiq.git
   cd frostiq
   ```

   If you've already cloned without submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Set up individual projects**
   Each subproject is independent and has its own setup instructions. Navigate to each project's directory and follow their respective README files:
   
   ```bash
   # Example for BakeryBackend
   cd BakeryBackend
   # Follow README instructions in that directory
   
   # Similarly for other projects
   cd ../bakery
   # Follow README instructions
   ```

### Running the Applications

Each subproject has its own setup and running instructions. Please refer to their respective README files for the most accurate information. Here's a general overview:

#### BakeryBackend

cd BakeryBackend
# Check the project's README for specific setup instructions
# Typically involves installing dependencies and starting the server
# Example (may vary):
# npm install
# npm start
```

#### Bakery Frontend
```bash
cd bakery
# Check the project's README for specific setup instructions
# Typically involves installing dependencies and starting the development server
# Example (may vary):
# npm install
# npm run dev
```

#### Hackmela & Torto-Forto
Navigate to each directory and follow their respective README files for specific instructions.
